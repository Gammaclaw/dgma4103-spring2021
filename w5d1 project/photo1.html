        <figcaption> I also play a side gacha game called Summoners War, and barbara is one of my dream nat5. I wanted her sister which is the fire element of her called Masha, but I am glad I got barbara. I have played this game since it was in its first year which was 2014, and now I started to play more of the game a year ago ever since it resurged back into popularity, and still love it ever since. Now it is celeberating its 7 year anniversary.</figcaption>
