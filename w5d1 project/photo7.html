        <figcaption>  I made my first friends by this cardgame called "Buddyfight", we played it when it first came out when we were in 7th grade. This card is my strongest card and the main aspect of the deck, it is also the better design of the original design. The game is discontinued and makes no more cards but we still play it.  </figcaption>
