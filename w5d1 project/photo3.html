        <figcaption> With my new gaming pc, I am able to play one of the games I have the most fun in the world with. I first played Fortnite on Ps4 with my controller, and I wanted a pc so badly. So now that I have one, I am able to play with peak performance. Fortnite and Overwatch were the first games that have brought me out to gaming and the world of gaming that I know and love now.  </figcaption>
